vtgrab is a program to copy the foreground terminal of one machine to
another, in order to allow remote monitoring.

In this package is:

- an RVC server (rvcd)
- a console client (rvc)
- an ncurses-based client (nrvc)

You can use it like this:

# ssh root@observed 'rvcd :6100 > /dev/null 2>&1 &'
$ nrvc observed:6100

The server needs to run as root on the observed machine.  The console
client also needs to run as root.

The eventual aim is to be able to use this in a teaching environment
in such a way that whatever is on the student's screen can be seen by
the tutor, including graphics.

If you have vncserver installed on the client machine, and
x0rfbserver installed on the server machine (with a patch to make it
accept --stealth as an argument), you will be able to monitor and
control X sessions too.

For x0rfbserver, see the RPMS I made at:

<URL:ftp://people.redhat.com/twaugh/SRPMS/>

You'll need the rfb package for x0rfbserver, and it depends on xclass
(also in that directory).
