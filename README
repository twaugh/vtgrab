vtgrab is a program to copy the foreground terminal of one machine to
another, in order to allow remote monitoring.

You can use it like this:

# ssh root@observed 'rvcd :6100&'; rvc observed:6100

(It needs to run as root on the observed machine.)

The eventual aim is to be able to use this in a teaching environment
in such a way that whatever is on the student's screen can be seen by
the tutor, including graphics.
