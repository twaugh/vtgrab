vtgrab is a program to copy the foreground terminal of one machine to
another, in order to allow remote monitoring.

You can use it like this:

# ssh observed 'vtgrab --server' | vtgrab --client

(Unfortunately, it needs to run as root on _both_ machines.)

The eventual aim is to be able to use this in a teaching environment
in such a way that whatever is on the student's screen can be seen by
the tutor, including graphics.  Ideally, someone would write an
x0rfbserver that would help with that last bit, hint hint Jens. ;-)

There seem to be some bugs which I don't fully understand in this
release: vtgrab sometimes has bad interactions with X when switching
the foreground console.  It might be something to do with VT_RELDISP.
